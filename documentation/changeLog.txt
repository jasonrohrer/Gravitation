Version 4

--Now builds against latest minorGems code.

--Fixed compiler warnings for latest GCC versions.



Version 3    2008-March-3

(Thanks to Chris Hecker for pointing out that player-freeze during fade-out
felt weird.)

--Re-enabled player motion during game-end fade-out.

--Added a 3-second title-screen freeze after fade-out to ensure that the player
  knows that the game is really over (so that key presses during the fade-out
  do not trigger a new game instantly).

--Kiln now stops melting blocks (because fire is gone) during fade-out.



Version 2    2008-February-29

--Increased fade-out time at end of game.

--Froze player during game-over fade-out.
